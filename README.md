Recreation of the old "Starfield" screensaver from Windows

## How to use
Open the file in a browser. Settings are on the right side (hover over the right 200px to make settings show up). Especially adjust the aspect ratio to match your monitor. Press F11 (on a PC) to maximize the browser so the stars fill the screen.
